Both Folders contain both raw and test data. Can be ignored.
If wanted new data can be generated given there is data stored in an E4 account.

Steps:
3 CSV files are already generated for use (df_result from analyzingcode.ipynb / df_all_eda df_all_hr from combiningmaincodes.ipynb) download these into your preferred directory
Make sure to change the paths in (final-code.py / analyzingcode.ipynb / combiningmaincodes.ipynb) according to your downloads
final-code.py is the main script to run the prototype, uses Streamlit servers to generate.
To run streamlit open command prompt to execute : streamlit run (path for final-code.py)
