# Challenge1
MAKE SURE FOR ALL SCRIPTS TO CHANGE THE PATHS
Folders contain both raw and test data. Can be ignored
3 CSV files are already generated for use (df_result from analyzingcode.ipynb / df_all_eda df_all_hr from combiningmaincodes.ipynb)
If wanted new data can be generated given there is data stored in an E4 account
final-code.py is the main script to run the prototype, uses Streamlit servers to generate.
